    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Bonnie A Ross Coaching, LLC</strong></p>
    
    <p>This Agreement is entered into by and between: Bonnie A Ross and Client (who purchases a Package) whereby Coach agrees to provide Coaching Services for Client.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Description of Coaching:</strong> Coaching is a partnership (defined as an alliance, not a legal business partnership) between the Coach and the Client in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires the client to maximize personal and professional potential. It is designed to facilitate the creation/development of personal, professional or business goals and to develop and carry out a strategy/plan for achieving those goals.</p>

            <strong>B.</strong> Client is solely responsible for creating and implementing their own physical, mental and emotional well-being, decisions, choices, actions and results arising out of or resulting from the coaching relationship and their coaching calls and interactions with the Coach. As such, the Client agrees that the Coach is not and will not be liable or responsible for any actions or inaction, or for any direct or indirect result of any services provided by the Coach. Client understands coaching is not therapy and does not substitute for therapy if needed, and does not prevent, cure, or treat any mental disorder or medical disease.

        <div class="subsection">
            <strong>E.</strong> Client acknowledges that coaching does not involve the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders as defined by the American Psychiatric Association and that coaching is not to be used as a substitute for counseling, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, or other professional advice by legal, medical or other qualified professionals and that it is the Client's exclusive responsibility to seek such independent professional guidance as needed. If Client is currently under the care of a mental health professional, it is recommended that the Client promptly inform the mental health care provider of the nature and extent of the coaching relationship agreed upon by the Client and the Coach.
